            During quarantine, all our artistic friends were painting amazing pieces. While that is great for them, we lack any artistic skills. We began our search for some paint by number kits to fake our own masterpieces, but quickly realized they were only for kids. Knowing that other adults also face this problem, we decided to introduce Challenging Paint by Number. Now adults can paint. No one else needs to know you had some help.
